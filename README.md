# vault-agent-templates
Sample vault agent configs and templates

This repo has some examples of `vault-agent` configuration and corresponding `consul templates` to fetch dynamic secrets from vault.

I will keep on adding new examples here, following are the one which are added already:

1. Template example to fetch azure dynamic secret engine
2. Template example to fetch PKI secrets from Vault

More examples to be added in coming days...
